# XI-IT1-U1-1-F18

Repository for the course XI-IT1-U1-1-F18 at University of Southern Denmark

This repository will contain all code examples, presentations and exercises that I use throughout the course.

The goal of this course is to learn all the basic skills and tools needed to build a modern website on an existing
webserver. It will explore multiple different technologies and approaches, but focus will remain on a preset
technology.
